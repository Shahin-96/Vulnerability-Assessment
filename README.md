# Analyze a vulnerable system of a small business 

## Project Overview
This project involves conducting a vulnerability assessment for a small e-commerce business. The primary objective is to evaluate the risks associated with a vulnerable information system, specifically a remote database server that has been publicly accessible since the company's launch. The assessment aims to identify potential threats, evaluate their impact on business operations, and propose remediation strategies to mitigate these risks.

## Objective
- Evaluate Security Risks: Assess the vulnerabilities associated with the company's remote database server and how they could potentially be exploited.
- Identify Threats: Determine the potential sources of threats and the types of threat events that could occur.
- Assess Impact: Evaluate the likelihood and severity of each identified threat, leading to an overall risk score.
- Propose Remediation: Develop and recommend security controls to remediate or mitigate the identified risks.

### Skills Learned

- Gained hands-on experience in conducting a vulnerability assessment, which is a critical task in cybersecurity.
- Learned how to evaluate risks by analyzing threat sources, events, likelihood, and severity.
- Practiced the approach of qualitative risk assessment, using subjective judgment to assess risks.
- Acquired skills in proposing effective security controls and strategies to address identified vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.
    
### Tools Used
- NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1

## Steps
### Part 1: Preparation
#### Access the Template:  
Downloaded and opened the vulnerability assessment report template.  
#### Review System Description and Scope:  
Analyzed the provided system description and scope to understand the components and boundaries of the assessment.
### Part 2: Perform the Risk Assessment
#### Write a Purpose Statement:  
Drafted a purpose statement outlining the objective of the vulnerability assessment.  
#### Identify Threat Sources:  
Using the NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1 resource, identified three potential threat sources relevant to the system.  
#### Identify Threat Events:  
Mapped the identified threat sources to potential threat events.  
#### Evaluate Risks:  
Assessed the likelihood and severity of each identified threat, then calculated the overall risk score.
### Part 3: Propose Security Recommendations
#### Explain Assessment Approach:  
Documented the rationale behind selecting the specific threat sources and events, focusing on their significance to the business.  
#### Develop Remediation Strategy:  
Proposed specific security controls (e.g., Principle of least privilege, Multi-factor authentication) to address the identified risks, ensuring alignment with the assessed threats.
